EA Sports Nhl statistics Scraper

Currently supports PS3 teams, but Xbox 360 support can be added with little effort.

Summary:
 - nhlstatsparse: python module to fetch and parse team & player stats from easports servers. (append to PYTHONPATH)
 - pyfibot_module: module for pyfibot irc bot (http://code.google.com/p/pyfibot/), which uses nhlstatsparse package.

Bot commands: 
 - .ts <team name>: Show Team Stats for team (always fetched from server)
 - .ps <player_name@team>: show player stats from a specific team. Within single request data is cached for 5 minutes for the whole team, making following requests from the same team faster.
