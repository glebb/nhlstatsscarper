EA Sports Nhl 14 statistics Scraper

Summary:
 - eanhlstats: python module to fetch and parse team & player stats from easports servers. (append lib to PYTHONPATH)
 - pyfibot_module: module for pyfibot irc bot (https://github.com/lepinkainen/pyfibot), which uses nhlstatsparse package. Place inside modules folder of pyfibot.

Bot commands: 
 .ts <team name>: Show Team Stats for team (always fetched from server)
 .ps <player_name@team>: show player stats from a specific team. Within single request data is cached for 5 minutes for the whole team, making following requests from the same team faster.

 .top <team name>: Show top 5 players from team.

Check interfacpy.py on how to use this thing.
